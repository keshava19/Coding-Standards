## 1.1 Purpose
The goal of these guidelines is to create uniform coding habits among software personnel in the engineering department so 
that reading, checking and maintaining code written by different people becomes easier. The intent of these standards is 
to define a natural style and consistency, yet leave to the authors of the engineering department source code, the freedom 
to practice their craft without unnecessary burden.

When a project adheres to common standards many good things happen:
 - Programmers can go into any code and figure out what's going on, so maintainability, readability, and reusability are 
 increased. Code walk throughs become less painful.
  - New people can get up to speed quickly.
  - People new to a language are spared the need to develop a personal style and defend it to death.
  - People new to a language are spared making the same mistakes over and over again, so reliability is increased.
  - People make fewer mistakes in consistent environments.
  - Idinsyncratic styles and college-learned behaviors are replaced with an emphasis on business concerns - high productivity,
  maintainability, shared authorship, etc.
  
  Experience over many projects points to the conclusion that coding standards help the project to run smoothly. They aren't 
  necessary for success, but they help. Most arguments against a particular standard come from the ego. Few decisions in a 
  reasonable standard really can be said to be technically deficient, just matters of taste. So, in the interests of establishing 
  the engineering department as a showcase software development environment, be flexible, control the ego a bit, and remember 
  any project is a team effort.
  
  A mixed coding style is harder to maintain than a bad coding style. So it's important to apply a consistent coding style 
  across a project. When maintaining code, it's better to conform to the style of the existing code rather than blindly follow 
  this document or your own coding style.
  
  Since a very large portion of project scope is after-delivery maintenance or enhancement, coding standards reduce the cost 
  of a project by easing the learning or re-learning task when code needs to be addressed by people other than the author, or 
  by the author after a long absence. Coding standards help ensure that the author need not be present for the maintenance and 
  enhancement phase.
