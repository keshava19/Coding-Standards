## 1.3 Coding Standard Documents
Each project shall adopt a set of coding standards consisting of three parts:
#### General Coding Standard
Described in this document.
#### Language Specific Coding Standards
For each language used, described in separate appendices to this document. These language standards shall supplement, rather than 
override, the General Coding Standards as much as possible.
#### Project Coding Standards
These standards shall be based on the coding standards in this document and on the coding standards for the given language(s). 
The project coding standards should supplement, rather than override, the General Coding Standards and the Language Coding 
Standards. Where conflicts between documents exist, the Project Standard shall be considered correct. Sweeping per-project 
customizations of the standards are discouraged, so that code can be reused from one project to another with minimal change.
