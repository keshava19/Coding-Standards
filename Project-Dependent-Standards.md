## 2. Project Dependent Standards
The standards and guidelines described in this document were selected on the basis of commoncoding practices of people within 
our group and from many language specific programming standarddocuments collected throughout the company and the Internet. They 
can’t be expected to becomplete or optimal for each project and for each language. Individual projects may wish to establish 
additional standards beyond those given here and the language specific documents. Keep inmind that sweeping per-project 
customizations of the standards are discouraged in order to make itmore likely that code throughout a project and across 
projects adopt similar styles.  

This is a list of coding practices that should be standardized for each project, and may requireadditional specification or 
clarification beyond those detailed in the standards documents.
### 1. Naming Conventions
What additional naming conventions should be followed. In particular, systematic prefixconventions for functional grouping of 
global data and also for names of structures,objects,  and other data types may be useful.
### 2. Project specific contents of module and subroutine headers
### 3. File Organization
- What kind of Include file organization is appropriate for the projects data hierarchy
- Directory structure
- Location of Make Files  
    > Actions taken before compilation is performed should be the directory in which the source code resides, unless otherwise 
    specified.
### 4. Specifications for Error Handling
- Specifications  for detecting and handling of errors.
- Specifications for checking boundary conditions for parameters passed to subroutines.
### 5. Revision and Version Control
Configuration of archives, projects, revision numbering, andrelease guidelines.
### 6. Guidelines for the use of “lint” or other code checking programs
### 7. Standardization of the development environment
- Compiler and linker options and directory structures
